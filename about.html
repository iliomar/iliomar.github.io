      <p>I'm Iliomar, born and raised in Puerto Rico, currently pursuing my Master's in Physics at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez. My interests span from particle physics and cosmology to exploring natural landscapes and languages. I enjoy running through tropical trails, playing guitar during sunset, and diving into Russian literature and linguistics. Science, music, and nature fuel my life and imagination.</p>
